# Task: Python study: Automate The BOring Stuff with Python
What I learnt:

I had only witnessed python working to solve a question, or any certain demand, but never knew it's practical uses

## All I have learnt:
# Basics:
- Flow control
- Functions, def
- Lists and tuples
- Dictionary and Structring Data
- Manipulating Strings
- Input Validation
- Appendix A for pip3 
# Applications:
- Reading and Writing Files
- Organising Files
- Debugging(My favourite topic)
- Excel 
- Pdf and Word doc
- GUI Automation
## To Study:
- Pattern Matching
- Web Scraping
- Google spreadsheets
- CSV and JSON FIles
-  Managing work
- Emails and text
- Image manipulation
## To complete:

Uploading the projects, and practice problems.
## Improvement:
Got familiarised with the uses of python, way ahead of what was taught in class. I became interested in finding easier ways to approach a task. Like in GUI automation.
## Where I need to improve on:
In the last lap, that is the last two days, I realised that I should have planned less time for theory and more for the assignments. So I need to work on abstraction of the requirement and work accordingly. I need to fix a time for the club activities, where I can devote more than 3 hrs per day.
## Experience:
Overall, I had spent 2 to 3 hrs a day to complete the study. It was engaging. And the club activity vibe held me in good spirits to complete it ASAP.
## Tentative date for completion: January 21st
